# Rent A Car 

In this project, I developed a structure focused on **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, utilizing modern software development techniques. By adhering to **CQRS** and **SOLID** principles, I built a **modular, scalable, and sustainable architecture** aligned with industry standards. **Synchronous and asynchronous repository patterns** were implemented across different layers to enhance data integrity and performance.  

## Key Features  

- **Advanced CRUD Operations**  
  Optimized with **Entity Framework** for efficient data management.  

- **Object Mapping**  
  **AutoMapper** was integrated to streamline mapping processes.  

- **Validation Pipeline**  
  **FluentValidation** ensures robust input validation across the application.  

- **Transaction Pipeline**  
  Maintains data consistency in critical operations.  

- **JWT-Based Authentication**  
  Strengthens security by implementing token-based authentication.  

- **Global Error Management**  
  Combined with extension methods to create a flexible structure.  

## Performance and Monitoring  

- **Caching**  
  Both **InMemory Cache** and **Redis Cache** were utilized to improve performance.  

- **Logging**  
  **Serilog** provided an advanced logging infrastructure for system monitoring and error analysis.  

## API Development  

- **Best Practices**  
  APIs were developed to align with industry standards.  

- **Mailing Functions**  
  Integrated with **C#/.NET** to handle email notifications.  

## Summary  

This project showcases my expertise in **enterprise software development processes**, **clean code principles**, and the ability to produce **advanced architectural solutions**. It highlights both the **technical depth** and adherence to **modern software standards**, reflecting my strengths in software development.
